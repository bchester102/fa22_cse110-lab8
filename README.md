## Check your understanding

1. I would put the test within a github action that runs whenever code is pushed because that means that tests will constantly be run on the code whenever changes are made.
2. You would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output, a unit test would be better for that since you're testing a small part of the code.
3. No, because the message functionality would be be reliant on multiple functions, which is not what unit testing is meant for.
4. Yes, because the max message length feature is a simple function, without needing to rely on considering user behavior, so unit testing would be ideal.
